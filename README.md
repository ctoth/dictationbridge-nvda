# DictationBridge NVDA add-on

This is the NVDA add-on package for DictationBridge. It depends on the [screen-reader-independent core](https://github.com/dictationbridge/dictationbridge-core).

Support for Dragon NaturallySpeaking is still under heavy development.

## Building

To build the add-on, you need Python 2.7, a recent version of SCons, and Visual Studio 2015.

First, fetch Git submodules with this command:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Then simply run SCons.
