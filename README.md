# DictationBridge NVDA add-on

This repository contains the Python code for the DictatioNBridge NVDA add-on. The source for the screen-reader-agnostic core code is not yet publicly available, and when it is, it will be in a separate repository.

This project is still very early in its development. You won't be able to build and use the add-on until we release the source code for the core sometime after the conclusion of the crowdfunding campaign.
